# Import your extensions to Coco

You can import the extension you developed to Coco to test if it will work as 
expected.

1. Open Coco settings page

   ![settings](../assets/settings_page.png)

2. Navigate to the "Extensions" tab

   ![settings](../assets/extensions_tab.png)

3. Click the "+" button then choose "Import Local Extension"

   ![import](../assets/import_local_extensions.png)

   This will launch your OS's file manager

4. Select the directory of your extension, then click the "Open" button

   ![select](../assets/select_your_extension.png)

   NOTE that you should select the extension directory, not the developer 
   directory.
